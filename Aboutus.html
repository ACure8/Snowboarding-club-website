    <p id="brickb">Snowboarding Club is about snowboarding and making friends. We're a unique type of club in that we meet on the mountain and are shamelessly about having a good time on the snow and making sure those around us have an awesome time too.</p>
    
    <h1 id="heading">Supportive and Inclusive</h1>
    <p id="para">The Snowboarding Club is about meeting new people and having good, clean fun on the mountain. Our members range in ability so there'll always be someone at a similar ability to you who'll be happy to ride with you or just be around for a catch up at lunch or at the end of the day.</p>
